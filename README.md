This project is a restaurant showcase website. It is a fullstack MERN application. The front-end consists of a React application hosted on Vercel and a back-end server hosted on Railway. The back-end server is connected to a MongoDB database hosted on MongoDB Atlas. The back-end server used a REST API and implements authentication with JWT. I implemented a booking system with a calendar and a multiple-steps form to make a reservation. It also uses Nodemailer to send emails to the restaurant owner when a reservation is made. The website is responsive and mobile-friendly.

You can use the following credentials to login in case you want to avoid the registration process:
